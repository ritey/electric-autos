						<li>Previous versions of this policy are available on request.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>1.3 Overview </strong><br>
					This Cookie Policy should be read in line with our <a href="{{ route('terms') }}">Terms and conditions</a> and our <a href="{{ route('privacy') }}">Privacy policy</a></p>

					<p><strong><a id="contents_2">2 What are cookies and associated technologies?</a></strong></p>

					<p><strong>2.1 Cookies and tracking technology overview</strong></p>

					<p>Where Coder Studios Ltd or its group companies talk about cookies and tracking technology on our websites (please see <a href="http://www.coderstudios.com">www.coderstudios.com</a> for a list of our brands) we refer to</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Cookies</li>
						<li>Flash Cookies</li>
						<li>Web Beacons</li>
						<li>Other Technology</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>2.1.1 Cookies</strong></p>

					<p>A cookie is tiny file that is stored on a user's computer and issued to your computer when you enter a website. It stores a small amount of information relating specifically to the client and the website. The cookie can be accessed by both the web server and the user's computer.</p>

					<p>Cookies are used for a wide range of purposes, such as identifying your computer's previous visits to a website, ascertaining the most popular features of a website or enable a company to present specific information to users.</p>

					<p>More information can be found in <a href="#contents_3">3. How you can control which cookies are set</a></p>

					<p><strong>2.1.2 Flash Cookies (Local Shared Objects) </strong></p>

					<p>A local shared object, sometimes called a "Flash cookie," is a data file that can be created on your computer by the sites you visit. They are most often used to enhance your web-browsing experience.</p>

					<p>Adobe's website provides details regarding <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html">Flash cookies</a></p>

					<p><strong>2.1.3 Web Beacons </strong></p>

					<p>To help us better manage content we employ web beacons in emails that we sent to our opted in subscribers.</p>

					<p>Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a userâ€™s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites.</p>

					<p>We use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients enabling us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

					<p>You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails.</p>

					<p><strong>2.1.4 Other technology</strong></p>

					<p>We will update this cookie policy to reflect any relevant changes / updates in technology.</p>

					<p><strong><a id="contents_2.2">2.2 Cookies and tracking technologies used on this site - how we use them and why</a></strong></p>

					<p><strong>2.2.1 Cookies : Type &amp; Duration There are two types of cookies:</strong></p>

					<ol>
						<li>"Session Cookies" - Stored temporarily in your computer's memory while you are visiting the site and deleted when you close your browser.</li>
						<li>"Persistent Cookies" - Stored for a set period on your computer and used to determine whether there has been any contact between us and your computer in the past.</li>
					</ol>

					<p><strong>2.2.2 Companies setting cookies on our website</strong></p>

					<p>When you visit our website cookies set can be:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>"1st Party Cookies" - cookies that are set by the website domain (or belonging to a sub domain) of this website.</li>
						<li>"3rd Party Cookies" - cookies that are set by another website domain e.g.
						<ul>
							<li>One of our technology partners</li>
							<li>External web services</li>
							<li>Social Buttons</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p><strong>2.2.3 Cookies : Classification</strong></p>

					<p>We are categorising cookies set on the site by ourselves and our main technology partners into the following categories</p>

					<p><strong>Category 1: Strictly necessary cookies</strong> These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around a website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you've asked for (such as access to secure areas) can't be provided. These cookies don't gather information about you that can be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.</p>

					<p><strong>Category 2: Performance cookies</strong> These cookies collect information about how you use a website, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get any error messages from certain pages. These cookies don't gather information that identifies you. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works. These cookies are not used to target you with online advertising. Without these cookies we can't learn how our website is performing and make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience.</p>

					<p><strong>Category 3: Functionality cookies</strong> These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you're in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced features and content for you. For instance, they can be used to remember log-in details, changes you've made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you've asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. These cookies ma be used to ensure that all our services and communications are relevant to you. The information these cookies collect cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you've previously made or personalise your browsing experience</p>

					<p><strong>Category 4: Targeting cookies or advertising cookies</strong> These cookies gather information about your browsing habits. They remember that you've visited a website and share this information with other organisations such as advertisers. They do this in order to provide you with ads that are more relevant to you and your interests. Although these cookies can track your visits to other websites, they don't usually know who you are. Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.</p>

					<p><strong>2.2.4 Cookies set by URL</strong></p>

					<p>We are currently confirming the cookies we set and will update this privacy policy when this activity is completed.</p>

					<p><strong>2.2.5 Our main technology partners</strong></p>

					<p>We work directly with a number of technology partners to maintain and support our website.</p>

					<p>We are currently confirming with them the cookies they set and will continue to update this cookie policy to reflect how they use cookies.</p>
